Here are files containing data from both the SBS and dataflashes of the various batteries that have been read while doing this project. BQ"number" indicates a type of battery, the number next to the battery type is the serial number as read from the battery ("0xFFFF"). Then appended to the end of the name is either "dataflash" (all the measurements and parameters stored in the dataflash) or "SBS" which indicates the data as read with the standard SBS commands as well as the extended SBS commands for the particular battery.
